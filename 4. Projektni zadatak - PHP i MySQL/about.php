				<h2>History of Lovište</h2>
				<p>At the very top of the Pelješac peninsula, there is Lovište, a picturesque village imprinted in a
					beautiful Adriatic bay. Lovište is one of the youngest settlements on Pelješac, founded only in the
					19th century. Lovište was inhabited by residents of other islands, and the first settler was from
					the island of Hvar, who left their homes affected by phylloxera, which ravaged the islands vineyards. The fact that the people of Hvar inhabited this area, perhaps we can thank the number of
					hours of sunshine that exceeds that of the sunniest island - 3000 hours and the rare rainfall adorns
					Loviste and the surrounding area.</p>
				<br>

				<p>Today, there are about 80 households and about two hundred permanent residents in Lovište. Although
					Pelješac is famous for its wines, olive growing is the most popular in Lovište, so the surroundings
					of Lovište are surrounded by numerous olive groves with over 10 thousand trees. Here, the pine has
					not yet supplanted the holm oak, and of the animal species, the most common are birds, however, we
					can also meet woodpeckers, mongooses, owls, down or wild boar. </p>
				<br>

				<p>Lovište has a long tradition of hospitality and tourism, so it is easy to find accommodation with
					friendly hosts in numerous apartments, rooms and holiday homes in Lovište.</p>
