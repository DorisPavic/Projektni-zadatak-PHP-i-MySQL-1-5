        <h2>Pelješac bridge connected</h2>

        <p>With the lifting of the last, 165th segment of the steel span structure, the Pelješac bridge was
                completely connected on Thursday and it stretches from Komarna on the mainland, to Brijesta on Pelješac.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>The bridge has 13 spans, of which five main ones are 285 meters long, six centrally placed reinforced
                concrete pylons 33 meters high, and two lanes together with a stop lane that will serve to maintain the
                bridge. The last element that was installed tonight is 18 meters long, and the symbolic installation was
                completed by Prime Minister Andrej Plenković, Minister of Transport Oleg Butković, Dubrovnik-Neretva
                County Prefect Nikola Dobroslavić and President of the Croatian Roads Administration Josip Škorić. The
                connection was followed by numerous citizens from the mainland and many boats, barges and other vessels.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The Peljesac Bridge is the first of a total of four phases of the "Road Connection with Southern
                Dalmatia" project, for which the European Commission has approved 357m euros in grants or 85 per cent of
                eligible costs.</p>
            <br>
            
            <p>The bridge along with access roads is expected to be open to traffic in June 2022, before the start of
                the main tourist season.</p>

        <h2>Fire in Lovište</h2>
        <p>A large fire broke out at around 11 am on the island of Pelješac, east of the settlement of Lovište in
                the municipality of Orebić. It is burning on a very difficult terrain where there are currently 30
                firefighters from companies on Pelješac. As we have learned from the commander of DVD Orebić, Nikša
                Nogalo, the forest fire near Lovište has been brought under control, thanks to the quick intervention of 
                firefighters. Firefighters from DVD Lovište, Orebić, Viganj, Trpanj and Kuna were taking part in the extinguishing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the forest fire that broke out in the area of Vučipolje on the northeast side of Lovište, a little
                more than three hectares of macchia, grass and several olive trees were burned.

                The causes are still being determined, and firefighters from the Orebic and Loviste Voluntary Fire
                Brigades are still on duty at the fire, soaking the edges, and they will monitor it until the fire is
                declared extinguished.
            </p>
             <br>
            <p>Thanks to the quick notification of the beginning of the fire and the intervention, the fire was brought
                under control at around 1 pm on Tuesday, thus preventing major material damage.

                On that occasion, the Fire Brigade again called on the population to exercise extreme caution, warning
                that in these hot days, and until November 1, it is strictly forbidden to light fires in the open.
